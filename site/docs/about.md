## Who I Am

I'm a passionate Computer Science student at University of Technology, specializing in web development and UI/UX design. I love turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive digital experiences.

With a background in design and a passion for technology, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality. I'm currently exploring machine learning applications in creative fields and building projects that make a difference.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, photography, or exploring new coffee shops around the city.
